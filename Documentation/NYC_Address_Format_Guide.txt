based on analysis of the all_building_addresses.csv file.

• Way    - Spelled out (e.g., "220 N End Way")
• Alley  - Spelled out (e.g., "4 Exchange Alley")

NUMBERED STREETS
----------------
• Use plain numbers without ordinal suffixes (th/st/nd/rd)
• Examples:
  - "5 Greenwich St" (not "5th Greenwich St")
  - "7 Pine St" (not "7th Pine St")  
  - "9 Gold St" (not "9th Gold St")

DIRECTION INDICATORS

  - W = West (e.g., "200 W St")
  - E = East
  - N = North (e.g., "220 N End Way")
  - S = South (e.g., "1 S William St")
