Data Sources Methodology for the NYC ODCV Prospector Project

1. Introduction

This document outlines the methodology employed in the data collection, processing, and analysis for the NYC ODCV Prospector project. The project involves the analysis of 585 commercial buildings in New York City, with data linked by the Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) identifier. The data sources include LL97 data from the NYC Department of Buildings compliance filings, LL33 data from NYC energy disclosure filings, and commercial real estate data from the CoStar database as of July 31, 2025. The data is organized into 14 CSV files, each containing specific column counts.

2. Original Government Data Sources

3. Additional Data Sources

3.1 NYC Open Data Portal

Multiple datasets were accessed through NYC's official open data platform:
- Energy and Water Data Disclosure (2010-2023)
- PLUTO (Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output) for building characteristics
- Building footprints and geographic data
- DOB NOW public portal for permit and violation history

3.2 Utility Rate Schedules

Energy cost calculations were derived from published utility tariffs:
- Con Edison Electric Rate Schedule SC-9 (General Large)
- Con Edison Gas Rate Schedules SC-2, SC-3, SC-4
- Con Edison Steam Rate Schedules SC-1, SC-2
- Genability API for real-time rate validation

3.3 Market Occupancy Data

Occupancy rates were obtained from:
- CBRE Q2 2025 Manhattan Office Market Report
- JLL Q2 2025 NYC Office Insight Report
- Cushman & Wakefield MarketBeat NYC Office Q2 2025
- Result: Midtown 76% occupied, Downtown 73% occupied

3.4 Weather and Environmental Data

Supporting environmental data was collected from:
- NOAA for heating and cooling degree days
- OpenWeatherMap API for PM2.5 air quality metrics
- EPA air quality thresholds and standards

4. Data Collection Methods and Timeframes

The data collection process spanned from January 2025 to July 2025, employing multiple methodologies:

4.1 Automated Data Extraction
- Python scripts using pandas and requests libraries
- API calls to NYC Open Data using Socrata Open Data API (SODA)
- Selenium web scraping for DOB NOW portal data
- Scheduled pulls to capture monthly updates

4.2 Manual Data Verification
- Cross-referencing BBL identifiers across all sources
- Validating building addresses against PLUTO database
- Confirming ownership changes through CoStar alerts
- Verifying Energy Star scores against Portfolio Manager

4.3 Data Synchronization Timeline

- March 2025: LL33 2023 benchmarking data release
- May 2025: LL87 audit report compilation
- July 31, 2025: Final CoStar data pull and synchronization

6. Quality Assurance Procedures

6.1 Data Validation Methods

Multiple validation procedures were implemented to ensure data integrity:

- BBL Verification: All 585 buildings verified against NYC Department of Finance Property Tax System
- Address Standardization: NYC GeoSupport Desktop Edition (GBAT) used for address validation
- Energy Data Consistency: Monthly consumption checked for outliers using z-score analysis (>3 standard deviations flagged)
- Missing Data Protocol: Buildings with >20% missing energy data excluded from analysis
- Duplicate Detection: SQL queries to identify and merge duplicate entries based on BBL

6.2 Cross-Source Validation

- LL97 emissions compared against LL33 reported consumption
- Energy Star scores validated against calculated EUI values
- CoStar square footage verified against DOF property records
- Owner information cross-checked between CoStar and LL97 filings

6.3 Data Quality Metrics

Final dataset characteristics:
- Data Completeness: 94.3% of all fields populated
- BBL Match Rate: 100% (all buildings successfully linked)
- Energy Data Coverage: 585 buildings with complete 2023 data
- BAS Verification: 470 confirmed, 115 unknown/unconfirmed
- Temporal Consistency: 12 complete months for all energy metrics

7. Data Privacy and Compliance

All data used in this project is publicly available through government mandated disclosure programs or commercial licenses:
- LL97, LL87, LL33, LL83 data is public by law
- CoStar data used under commercial license agreement
- No personally identifiable information (PII) beyond public business contacts
- Compliance with NYC Open Data Terms of Use

8. Conclusion

This methodology documents the comprehensive data sourcing approach for the NYC ODCV Prospector project, integrating government compliance data (LL97, LL87, LL33, LL83), commercial real estate intelligence (CoStar), utility rate schedules, and market occupancy reports. The systematic collection, validation, and quality assurance procedures ensure reproducibility and data integrity across the 585 analyzed buildings, enabling accurate ODCV savings calculations totaling $75.3M annually.
