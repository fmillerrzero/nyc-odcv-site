Calculations Justifications Methodology for the NYC ODCV Prospector Project

1. Introduction

This document outlines the methodology employed in the NYC ODCV Prospector project to calculate potential savings and evaluate buildings based on a 110-point scoring system. The methodology is designed to ensure a comprehensive and accurate assessment of each building's potential for ODCV implementation and savings.

2. ODCV Savings Calculation

2.1 Core Formula

The core formula used for calculating ODCV savings is: Savings = HVAC Energy × 30% unoccupied time × 30% savings rate. This formula is applied to three energy types: electricity (direct), gas (90% HVAC × 30% × 30%), and steam (90% HVAC × 30% × 30%).

2.2 Occupancy Rates

Occupancy rates are derived from Q2 2025 market data, with Midtown and Downtown rates standing at 76% and 73% respectively. It is assumed that ODCV savings occur during the 30% unoccupied time.

2.3 Assumptions

The assumption of 30% ODCV savings aligns with industry standards. The minimum HVAC justification of 15% is based on the requirements of 24/7 ventilation pumps and controls.

3. 110-Point Scoring System Details

3.1 Financial Impact

The financial impact is calculated using the formula: 40 × ((586 - rank) / 585). The highest ranked building receives 40 points, while the lowest ranked building receives nearly 0 points.

3.2 BAS Infrastructure

The presence of a Building Automation System (BAS) is a binary gate in the scoring system. Buildings without a BAS receive 0 points as ODCV implementation is not possible. Buildings with a BAS receive 15 base points, with additional points awarded for heating and cooling automation, and the year the system was altered.

3.3 Owner Portfolio

Points are awarded based on the size of the owner's portfolio, with more points given to owners with more buildings.

3.4 Implementation Ease

Points are awarded based on the number of units in the building, with fewer units receiving more points.

3.5 Prestige Bonuses

Additional points are awarded for buildings with LEED certification, Energy Star rating, and Class A status.

4. Key Facts

The methodology was applied to 585 buildings, of which 470 have a BAS. The total annual savings identified amount to $75.3M. The methodology prioritizes sales readiness over pure savings.

5. Conclusion

The methodology outlined in this document provides a robust and comprehensive approach to calculating potential ODCV savings and evaluating buildings for ODCV implementation. The use of a 110-point scoring system allows for a nuanced assessment of each building's potential, taking into account a range of factors from financial impact to implementation ease. The methodology is designed to be replicable, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the evaluation process.
