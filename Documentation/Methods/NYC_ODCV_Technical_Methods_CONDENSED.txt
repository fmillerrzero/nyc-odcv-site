# NYC ODCV PROSPECTOR - CONDENSED TECHNICAL METHODS

## 1. HVAC ELECTRICITY DISAGGREGATION

**Formula:** `baseline = min_daily × days × 0.85`

Calculates non-HVAC baseline using minimum daily electricity across all months, multiplied by days in month, with 0.85 multiplier. Assumes 15% minimum HVAC (ventilation, pumps, controls) in lowest consumption month.

**Validation Results:**
- No buildings had zero HVAC with non-zero electricity
- Minimum HVAC: exactly 15.0% (657 month-building combinations between 14.9%-15.1%)
- Average HVAC Usage: **28.3%** across all buildings

**Output:** 48 new columns in energy_BIG_disaggregated.csv
- Elec_HVAC_[Month]_2023_kBtu
- Elec_NonHVAC_[Month]_2023_kBtu
- Elec_HVAC_[Month]_2023_Cost_USD
- Elec_NonHVAC_[Month]_2023_Cost_USD

## 3. ODCV SAVINGS CALCULATION

**Core Formula:** 
Savings = HVAC Energy × 30% unoccupied time × 30% savings rate

**Applied to:**
- Electricity: Direct calculation
- Gas: 90% HVAC portion × 30% × 30%
- Steam: 90% HVAC portion × 30% × 30%

**Occupancy Rates:**
- Midtown: 76% occupied
- Downtown: 73% occupied
- Assumption: 30% unoccupied time when ODCV savings occur

**Total Identified Savings:** $75.3M annually across 585 buildings

## 4. 110-POINT SCORING SYSTEM

### Financial Impact (40 points)
**Formula:** 40 × ((586 - rank) / 585)
- Rank 1 = 40 points
- Rank 585 = ~0 points

### BAS Infrastructure (30 points) - BINARY GATE
- **No BAS = 0 points** (deal breaker, cannot implement ODCV)
- Has BAS = 15 base points plus:
  - Heating automation: +2.5 (YES) or -1 (NO)
  - Cooling automation: +2.5 (YES) or -1 (NO)
  - Year altered: 10 points (2020+) to 0 (pre-1990)

### Owner Portfolio (20 points)
**Owner:**
- 10+ buildings: 15 points
- 5-9 buildings: 10 points
- 2-4 buildings: 6 points
- 1 building: 3 points

**Manager:** 1-5 additional points based on portfolio size

### Implementation Ease (10 points)
- 1-5 units: 5 points
- 6-10 units: 4 points
- 11-20 units: 3 points
- 21-50 units: 2 points
- 51+ units: 0 points

### Prestige Bonuses (10 points)
- LEED: up to 3 points
- Energy Star: up to 3 points
- Class A: up to 4 points

**Key Principle:** Sales readiness > pure savings
Example: $1.4M savings with no BAS ranks below $500K with BAS

## 5. ENERGY COST CALCULATIONS

### SC-9 Rate I
- Customer: $71/month
- Demand: Summer $42.80/kW, Winter $33.50/kW
- Energy: 1.66¢/kWh

### SC-9 Rate II (Time-of-Use)
- Customer: $500/month
- Summer Demand:
  - M-F 8AM-6PM: $11.59/kW
  - M-F 8AM-10PM: $23.35/kW
  - All hours: $21.09/kW
- Winter Demand:
  - M-F 8AM-10PM: $18.60/kW
  - All hours: $5.60/kW
- Energy: 0.79¢/kWh

### Conversion
- kBtu to kWh: 1 kWh = 3.412 kBtu
- Total Cost = Customer + Demand + Energy charges

### Gas/Steam Rates
- Gas: SC-2 $2.23/therm, SC-3 $2.00/therm, SC-4 $1.75/therm
- Steam: SC-1 ~$72.86/Mlb, SC-2 ~$48.51/Mlb
