# NYC ODCV PROSPECTOR - COMPLETE CONDENSED METHODOLOGY

## CORE CALCULATIONS

### HVAC Electricity Disaggregation
**Formula:** `baseline = min_daily × days × 0.85`
- 15% minimum HVAC for 24/7 operations (ventilation, pumps, controls)
- Result: 28.3% average HVAC across 585 buildings
- Validation: No buildings below 15%, only 2.6% had February minimum (avoided bias)
- Output: 48 columns in energy_BIG_disaggregated.csv

### ODCV Savings 
**Formula:** Savings = HVAC Energy × Unoccupied% × 30% savings rate
- Electricity: Direct calculation
- Gas/Steam: 90% HVAC portion × Unoccupied% × 30%
- Total: $75.3M annually (585 buildings)

### Office Percentage
**Formula:** Office% = Office Square Footage / Total Building Square Footage
- Source: CoStar tenant data (July 31, 2025 pull)
- Purpose: Apply ODCV only to office portions

### Neighborhood Occupancy
- Midtown: 76% occupied (24% savings window)
- Downtown: 73% occupied (27% savings window)
- Source: Q2 2025 market data

## 110-POINT SCORING SYSTEM

**Financial (40 pts):** 40 × ((586 - rank) / 585)

**BAS Infrastructure (30 pts):** Binary gate
- No BAS = 0 (deal breaker)
- Has BAS = 15 base + heating/cooling bonuses + age factor

**Portfolio (20 pts):** Owner size (3-15) + Manager (1-5)

**Implementation (10 pts):** Inverse tenant count (5 pts for 1-5 units → 0 for 51+)

**Prestige (10 pts):** LEED (3) + Energy Star (3) + Class A (4)

**Philosophy:** Sales readiness > pure savings ($1.4M no-BAS ranks below $500K with-BAS)

## ENERGY COSTS

### Electricity (SC-9)
**Rate I:** $71/mo + demand ($42.80 summer/$33.50 winter per kW) + 1.66¢/kWh
**Rate II:** $500/mo + time-of-use demand + 0.79¢/kWh

### Gas: SC-2 $2.23/therm, SC-3 $2.00/therm, SC-4 $1.75/therm
### Steam: SC-1 $72.86/Mlb, SC-2 $48.51/Mlb
### Conversion: 1 kWh = 3.412 kBtu
