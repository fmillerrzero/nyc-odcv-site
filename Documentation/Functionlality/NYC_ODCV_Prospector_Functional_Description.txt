4. DATA PROCESSING & CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

ODCV SAVINGS METHODOLOGY
------------------------
• Base Assumption: 30% reduction in HVAC energy during unoccupied hours
• Occupancy Assumption: 70% occupied hours (based on NYC trends)
• Energy Types: Separate calculations for electricity, gas, and steam
• Monthly Granularity: Accounts for seasonal variations
• Cost Basis: Actual 2023 energy rates from utility tariffs

SCORING ALGORITHM (110 POINTS TOTAL)
-------------------------------------
1. Financial Impact (40 points)
   • ODCV annual savings scaled to portfolio
   • LL97 penalty avoidance value
   • Total present value calculations

2. BAS Infrastructure (30 points)
   • Binary: Has BAS = 30 points, No BAS = 0 points
   • Critical gate for sales readiness
   • Sub-scores for heating/cooling automation

3. Ownership Scale (20 points)
   • Points based on owner's portfolio size
   • Recognizes enterprise sales opportunities
   • Weighted by total portfolio savings potential

4. Implementation Complexity (10 points)
   • Inverse correlation with tenant count
   • Bonus for larger typical floor plates
   • Simpler buildings score higher

5. Prestige Bonuses (10 points)
   • LEED certification: +3 points
   • Energy Star certified: +3 points
   • Class A building: +4 points

RANKING LOGIC
-------------
• Sales Readiness > Pure Savings Amount
• Example: $1.4M savings with no BAS ranks below $500K with perfect infrastructure
• Prioritizes immediately actionable opportunities
• Reduces sales cycle time and implementation barriers
